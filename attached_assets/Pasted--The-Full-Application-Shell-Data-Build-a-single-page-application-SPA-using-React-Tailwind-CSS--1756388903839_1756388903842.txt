. The Full Application Shell & Data
Build a single-page application (SPA) using React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router. The app should have a central data store as a JavaScript object (not a database) containing at least 10 dummy suppliers. Each supplier object must have these properties: id, name, carbonFootprint, waterUsage, recyclingPolicy (boolean), ISO14001 (boolean), riskScore, and an array for historicalCarbon.

The app must have these primary routes: /, /onboarding, /procurement, /procurement/suppliers, /procurement/simulator, and /supplier.

2. The Pages
Page 1: Onboarding (/onboarding)
Create a multi-step form to onboard a new supplier. It should have a progress indicator at the top. The form will ask these questions, one by one:

What is your company's name?

What is your total carbon footprint (in tons)?

Do you have an ISO 14001 certification? (Yes/No)

Do you have a publicly available water policy? (Yes/No)

Do you have a recycling program? (Yes/No)

On the final step, a "Submit" button should add the new supplier to the central data store.

Page 2: Home (/)
A simple landing page with a clean layout. It should have a large title like "Sustainable Supply Chain." Include three clear call-to-action buttons for navigation:

"Enter Procurement Dashboard" (links to /procurement)

"Are you a Supplier?" (links to /supplier)

"New Supplier? Sign Up" (links to /onboarding)

Page 3: Procurement Dashboard (/procurement)
This page is for the procurement manager and should be heavily graph-oriented. It needs to provide a high-level overview of all suppliers.

Display three large metric cards at the top:

Total Suppliers

Average Sustainability Score

Certified Suppliers

Graph 1: Risk Distribution (Doughnut Chart): Show the percentage of suppliers in "High," "Medium," and "Low" risk categories.

Graph 2: Sustainability Score Distribution (Histogram): A bar chart showing the frequency of suppliers within different score ranges (e.g., 0-20, 21-40, etc.).

Graph 3: Average Performance by Metric (Radar Chart): A radar chart visualizing the average score of all suppliers across key metrics like Carbon Footprint, Water Usage, and Recycling.

Page 4: Supplier List & Ranking (/procurement/suppliers)
A page to filter and sort the supplier list with a powerful visualization.

Include a filterable and sortable table of all suppliers. The table should have columns for: Name, Sustainability Score, Risk Level, Carbon Footprint.

Graph 4: Top vs. Bottom Performers (Horizontal Bar Chart): A bar chart highlighting the 5 best and 5 worst suppliers based on their sustainability score.

Page 5: Supplier Detail (/procurement/suppliers/:id)
A detailed report page for a single supplier.

Graph 5: Performance Breakdown (Radar Chart): A radar chart showing the specific supplier's scores on different metrics (Carbon Footprint, Water Usage, Recycling Policy).

Graph 6: Historical Footprint (Line Chart): A line chart showing the supplier's historicalCarbon data over time.

Include a dynamic text section that provides personalized improvement recommendations based on the supplier's weaknesses.

Page 6: Simulation (/procurement/simulator)
A page for "what-if" analysis.

Create two dropdowns: one for a "Current Supplier" and one for a "Prospective Supplier."

Include an input for "Order Quantity."

When a "Run Simulation" button is clicked, a Grouped Bar Chart should appear. This chart must directly compare the Carbon Footprint and Water Usage of both suppliers, visually representing the projected environmental savings based on the order quantity.

Page 7: Supplier Portal (/supplier)
A simplified page for suppliers to view their own data.

Graph 7: My Performance Breakdown (Radar Chart): A radar chart that shows only the logged-in supplier's performance scores on each metric.

Graph 8: My Historical Footprint (Line Chart): A line chart showing only the supplier's own historical data.

Display a section with their specific improvement recommendations.
